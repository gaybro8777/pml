      <h3>PML 3 Proof Terms</h3>

      <p>There are two key constructs that make it possible to operate
      proof-theoretically with the PROV Ontology. One is the ability
      to tie processual provenance to derivational provenance. We
      enable this by defining <a
       href="#hadAntecedent">pml:hadAntecedent</a>, a subproperty of
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#used">prov:used</a> We also
      define a qualified form of <a
       href="#hadAntecedent">pml:hadAntecedent</a> called <a
       href="#Antecedent">pml:Antecedent</a>. The other is the ability
      to check activities against plans for those activities. Since
      this requires no additional classes or properties, we discuss it
      below.</p>

      <h4>prov:Plans as classes of Activiities</h4>

      <p>In PROV, only things that have happened can be directly
      asserted. If something hasn't happened yet, it is considered to
      be a plan or expectation of what will happen. Because of this,
      we cannot directly encode plans as graphs of provenance, but
      instead, we need to look to defining classes of things which
      might happen in the future. It is sensible to use OWL to define
      these as much as possible. Towards this end, we pun instances
      of prov:Plan to also be subclasses of prov:Activity.</p>


      <p>It is possible to mark successful the execution of a prov:Plan by an
      activity. This is needed because the base specification only
      defines plans as something that prov:Agents have during
      a prov:Activity, but does not say anything about how that
      activity conforms to that plan. It is possible to declare that a
      prov:Activity conforms to a prov:Plan by making the activity an
      instantiation of that plan. Conversely, an
      failed prov:Activity would belong to the complement of the
      prov:Plan.</p>

      <p>Since this strategy uses <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL
      2 punning</a> it may be useful to describe the method. In
      non-OWL Full OWL 2, "punning" is used to separate the class,
      property, and individual attributes of a resource into separate
      denotations, that for a class, property, and individual. Any
      assertions about the class are never used to infer triples
      about the individual or property. The respective assertions hold
      for individuals and properties. This allows users of OWL 2 to,
      for instance, speak of the species Eagle as both a class of all
      Eagles (which all have certain attributes which can be defined
      via subsumption, domains and ranges, and property restrictions),
      and the species Eagle which is true about the species, but not
      the individuals of the species. One thing that is true is that
      the species Eagle belongs to the meta class "Plant and Animal
      Species". This allows for direct metamodeling within the OWL
      framework without having to result to OWL Full inferences. We
      see this same relationship between the class prov:Activity and the
      meta-class prov:Plan, instances of which define activities.</p>

      <p>An example can be more illustrative than
      a prose description. Here is an example using Modus Ponens (in TTL):</p>

<pre>
logic:ModusPonens a prov:Plan; owl:Class;
   rdfs:subClassOf prov:Activity.
 
:mpAct1 a prov:Activity, logic:ModusPonens.
   prov:qualifiedAssociation [
     prov:agent :Jim;
     prov:hadPlan logic:ModusPonens
   ];
   prov:wasAssociatedWith :Jim;
   prov:used [
     a prov:Entity, logic:ConditionalStatement;
     prov:value "X is a man => X is a mortal."
   ];
   prov:used [
     a prov:Entity, logic:Statement;
     prov:value "Socrates is a man."
   ].
 
:mpConclusion a logic:Statement, prov:Entity;
   prov:value "Socrates is a mortal.";
   prov:wasGeneratedBy :mpAct1.
</pre>

    <p>The core of this technique is that Modus Ponens is both an
    instance of plan and also a class. All instances of Modus Ponens
    are also activities. mpAct1 is an activity and an instance of
    Modus Ponens, and was associated with Jim, who had the plan Modus
    Ponens. The activity used a conditional statement, "X is a man, =>
    X is a mortal." and a statement "Socrates is a man."  to generate
    a statement "Socrates is a mortal." Because the activity was an
    instance of Modus Ponens, and Jim had the plan of Modus Ponens, we
    can determine that the plan succeeded. Conversely, if mpAct1 was
    an instance of the complement of Modus Ponens, we could determine
    that Jim's plan failed. Similarly, if the plan were to be an
    instance of a subclass of Modus Ponens, for instance, a particular
    Forward Chaining algorithm, we would still determine that Jim's
    plan succeeded because mpAct1 would be an instance of Modus Ponens
    by subsumption.</p>

    <p>While PROV's Plan is something of intent, we use OWL 2 punning
    to extend it to something which has also occurred. This provides
    us with several advantages:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>It is possible to directly query for activities that
      follow certain plans, and follow the inheritance hierarchy of
      it, simply by querying for instances of the plan in question. A
      query engine backed by reasoning would be able to follow the
      subsumption hierarchy, while a non-reasoning query engine could
      still search for direct assertions of type. For instances, more
      abstract plans, such as modus ponens, are super classes of more
      specific algorithms, such as forward chaining, and particular
      implementations, such as the forward chaining implementation
      from the Jena rule inference engine. Querying for instances of
      Modus Ponens would then also return instances of forward
      chaining by a Jena rule inference engine through simple class
      subsumption.</li>

      <li>It is possible to express when an activity doesn't go
      according to plan, simply by expressing a disjoint class of the plan of
      an agent.</li>
      
      <li>It is possible to partially define a plan in terms of the
      provenance it will produce as OWL restrictions on the
      Plan-as-class, as shown below.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This third advantage can be shown by extending the modus ponens
    example (in Manchester Notation):</p>

<pre>
Class: logic:ModusPonens
   SubClassOf: pml:InferenceStep, prov:Activity
   EquivalentClass: 
           prov:used exactly 1 logic:ConditionalStatement 
       and prov:used exactly 2 logic:Statement
       and prov:used only logic:Statement
       and prov:generated exactly 1 logic:Statement
 
Class: logic:Statement
 
Class: logic:ConditionalStatement
   SubClassOf logic:Statement
</pre>
    
    <p>We are defining modus ponens by stating that it takes two
    statements, one of them being a conditional statement, and
    produces another statement. This obviously isn't a full definition
    of ModusPonens, but it does define it as a black box, in that it
    defines what inputs and outputs can be expected.</p>

    <p>By following this definition, we know that any activity that is
    a successful use of Modus Ponens uses a certain number and type of
    logical statements and that it produces a logical statement. By
    punning the plan and class together, we provide a natural way to
    mix the parts of the plan that can be defined in OWL with other
    specifications on the prov:Plan-as-individual.</h4>
    

    <h4>Variable Mapping</h4>

    <p>Variable mapping captures the result (substitution) of unifying
    variables of premises/antecedents of a conclusion. A variable
    mapping records the mapping from a 'variable' to a 'term' (both
    variable and term are first logic concepts). Each variable mapping
    maps to one substitution. Note that variable mapping only captures
    string-replace alike substitution, we do not assume any
    understanding/parsing of the sentences mentioned in
    antecedents. Variable mapping occurs by creating a typed value as
    an entity.  The types of the value are resources that denote the
    variable slot in whichever function the activity has enacted. The
    physical literal that is used as the replacement string is the
    prov:value of the class. The value of the variable is referenced
    using prov:value on the prov:Entity. For example:</p>

    <pre>
:act a prov:Activity, java:java.util.regex.Pattern.compile;
  prov:entity [
    a java:java.util.regex.Pattern.compile#regex,
      java:java.lang.String;
    prov:value "o+"
  ].

java:java.util.regex.Pattern.compile#regex prov:value "regex".

:p a java:java.util.regex.Pattern;
  prov:wasGeneratedBy :act. </pre>

    <p>A method call on java.util.regex.Pattern.compile() uses a
    string "o+" as the regular expression
    (java.util.regex.Pattern.compile#regex) parameter in a function
    call, which produces a java.util.regex.Pattern.</p>

    <h4>Antecedent Ordering</h4>

    <p>Antecedents can be ordered using a qualified pml:Antecedent,
    giving it a pml:Position as its prov:atLocation. Ordering and
    number of antecedents can be defined using the class that the
    prov:Activity belongs to.</p>
